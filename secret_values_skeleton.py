# This is a skeleton file. You need to make a copy of it. And then rename the copy to secret_values.py. You need to store our secret values in there. secret_values.py is in our .gitignore so it should never be uploaded to Github. Do not upload the real secret_values.py to github, only this skeleton version. Otherwise people will use our stuff.

MY_SECRET_CHAT_GPT_KEY_PLS_DONT_STEAL_THIS_THX = '' # replace this empty string with your Chat GPT API Key string in the real secret_values.py. Do not replace it here in the _skelton file
